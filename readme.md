# Lunar
Lunar is a neural network aim assist that uses real-time object detection accelerated with CUDA on Nvidia GPUs.

## About

Lunar can be modified to work with a variety of FPS games; however, it is currently configured for Fortnite. Besides being general purpose, the main advantage of using Lunar is that it does meddle with the memory of other processes.

The basis of Lunar's player detection is the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) architecture written in PyTorch.

A demo video (outdated) can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDAcQNUuT84).
